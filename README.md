# nocuous

A static code analysis tool for JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Background

The statistics collected around code toxicity are based directly on Eric
DÃ¶rnenburg's article [How toxic is your code?](https://erik.doernenburg.com/2008/11/how-toxic-is-your-code/).

The default metrics are based on what is written there, but when applied to
JavaScript/TypeScript, there are some changes that make sense.

| Metric                          | Description                                                                                     | Default Threshold |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| File length                     | The number of lines in a file.                                                                  | 500               |
| Class fan-out complexity        | The number of classes or interfaces in the dependency chain for a given class.                  | 30                |
| Class data abstraction coupling | The number of instances of other classes that are "new"ed in a given class.                     | 10                |
| Anon Inner Length               | Class expressions of arrow functions length in number of lines.                                 | 35                |
| Function Length                 | The number of statements in a function declaration, function expression, or method declaration. | 30                |
| Parameter Number                | The number of parameters for a function or method                                               | 6                 |
| Cyclomatic Complexity           | The cyclomatic complexity for a function or method                                              | 10                |
